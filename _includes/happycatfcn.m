% Computes the value of the Happy Cat benchmark function.
% SCORES = HAPPYCATFCN(X) computes the value of the Happy Cat function at 
% point X. HAPPYCATFCN accepts a matrix of size M-by-N and returns a vetor 
% SCORES of size M-by-1 in which each row contains the function value for 
% the corresponding row of X. 
% SCORES = HAPPYCAT(X, ALPHA) specifies power of the sphere component of 
% the function.
