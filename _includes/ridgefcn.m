% Computes the value of the Ridge benchmark function.
% SCORES = RIDGEFCN(X) computes the value of the Ridge function at point X.
% RIDGEFCN accepts a matrix of size M-by-N and returns a vetor SCORES of 
% size M-by-1 in which each row contains the function value for the 
% corresponding row of X. 
% SCORES = RIDGEFCN(X, D) specifies contribution coefficient of the sphere 
% component of the function.
% SCORES = RIDGEFCN(X, D, APLPHA) specifies power of the sphere component of 
% the function.
