% Computes the value of the Shubert function.
% SCORES = SHUBEERTFCN(X) computes the value of the Shubert 
% function at point X. SHUBEERTFCN accepts a matrix of size M-by-N and 
% returns a vetor SCORES of size M-by-1 in which each row contains the 
% function value for the corresponding row of X.
